### 5. Social Links

To enable social links on your blog simply enter your social profile username, for example, twitter: "justgoodthemes" . If a field is left blank, the social icon will not be shown.

### 6. Site Navigation

The site navigation can be found in the **_config.yml** file. To add a page to the site navigation simply add your new page in the markdown format (e.g. newpage.md) in the theme root folder. Next edit your navigation menu located in **_config.yml** file on line 26. To add a new item to the navigation you have to add the item name and url. For example:

~~~~
navigation:
- text: New Page
url: /newpage
~~~~

### 7. Images

Images for pages are located in the horace/assets/images folder and images for posts are located in the horace/assets/images/posts directory.

#### Image With Caption

Within your blog posts you can include captions for images. This requires using some HTML markup.

The example below illustrates how to include an image with a caption in a blog post:

~~~~
{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/images/posts/Apple-Watch-In-Car.jpg" 
title="Apple Super" caption="supertest" %}
~~~~

Add the following code into your post/page markdown and change its attributes accordingly.

#### Full Width Image With Caption

To have wide images in posts or pages simply add #wide word with the hashtag at the end of image path like in the example below:

~~~~
{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/images/posts/Apple-Watch-In-Car.jpg#wide" 
title="Apple" caption="This is caption" %}
~~~~

Add the following code into your post/page markdown and change its attributes accordingly.

#### Image alignment

To align images left or right just us the **div** with class **alignleft** or **alignright**. Please, check the example below:

~~~~
<div class="alignright">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/5.jpg" alt="image name">
</div>
~~~~

### 8. Local Instalation

To set up Jekyll on local machine please follow the official documentation that can be found here -> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/.

### 9. Deployment

Sites built using Jekyll can be deployed in a large number of ways due to the static nature of the generated output. Here are some of the most common ways:

#### Netlify

This theme is intended to be used with **GitHub/Gitlab + Netlify** workflow. You set up a private repository on your chosen Git service and link it to Netlify. You can find here how to do it [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/). As this theme is Netlify ready, you don't have to to create any Gemfile files. After you set up Git repo, just start from the step **"Connecting to Netlify"**. To read more about Netlify features visit the following this [link](https://www.netlify.com/features/). As for Netlify pricing, the basic plan is free that will covers all blogging needs.

#### Amazon S3

If you want to host your site on Amazon S3, you can do so by using the [s3_website application](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website). It will push your site to Amazon S3 where it can be served like any web server, dynamically scaling to almost unlimited traffic.

#### Manual Deployment

Jekyll generates your static site to the **_site** directory by default. You can transfer the contents of this directory to almost any hosting provider to get your site live. Here are some manual ways of achieving this:

##### FTP

Most traditional web hosting providers let you upload files to their servers over FTP. To upload a Jekyll site to a web host using FTP, run the jekyll build command and copy the contents of the generated **_site** folder to the root folder of your hosting account. This is most likely to be the httpdocs or public_html folder on most hosting providers.
